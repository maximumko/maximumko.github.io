Welcome to my academic portfolio. I am a Ph.D. candidate at Oregon Health & Science University focusing on alternative polyadenylation mechanisms and their role in cancer biology.

## About Me

I am passionate about understanding the complexities of post-transcriptional regulation and how alternative polyadenylation contributes to cancer development and progression. My research combines computational approaches with experimental validation to explore the intricate relationships between RNA processing and disease states.

Currently working in the [Xia Lab](https://xiazlab.org/), I am investigating APA at single-cell RNA-Seq and spatial transcriptomics levels, providing unprecedented insights into 3' UTR processing dynamics across different cell types and spatial contexts in cancer models. Additionally, I am developing robust computational pipelines for APA analysis using Nextflow and adhering to nf-core standards, ensuring reproducibility and scalability in bioinformatics workflows.

## Research Interests

- **Alternative Polyadenylation (APA)**: Investigating mechanisms and functional consequences of APA in normal and disease states
- **Single-cell and Spatial Transcriptomics**: Exploring APA dynamics at cellular and spatial resolution
- **Computational Methods for APA**: Developing novel APA analyze tools for scRNA/spatial data & nf-core compatible pipelines for APA analysis
